## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**DarkVisionOA is not intended to replace OpenAsar.**

I created this project primarily for myself and my friends to use. It is a personal fork designed to test specific features and customizations. While other users are welcome to try it, please keep the following in mind:

* **It is not perfect:** You may encounter bugs, experimental features, or unoptimized code.
* **It is a hobby project:** Updates and features are prioritized based on personal use cases.
* **Experimental DOM-Based Plugins:** This client introduces a "DOM-based Plugin" system.
    * Since this acts as a custom "Discord starter modification" rather than a full custom client (and does not utilize complex Webpack patching), these plugins operate by directly interacting with the DOM using class names and optimized observers.
    * These plugins will be marked as **Unstable**.
    * **Auto-Fixing:** Ideally, these plugins are designed to be self-correcting; as Discord updates and changes class names, the system aims to dynamically resolve the new identifiers to prevent bugs.

If you are looking for the standard, stable experience, please stick with the official OpenAsar.
