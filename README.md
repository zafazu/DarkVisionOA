## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**DarkVisionOA is not intended to replace OpenAsar.**

I created this project primarily for myself and my friends to use. It is a personal fork designed to test specific features and customization. While other users are welcome to try it, please keep in mind:
* **It is not perfect:** You may encounter bugs or useless features or unoptimized code.
* **It is a hobby project:** Updates and features are decided by us.

If you are looking for the standard, stable experience, please stick with the official OpenAsar.
